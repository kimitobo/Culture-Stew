### Background ###

Culture Stew, Hack Culture Taiwan x Finland, is a workshop series by New Media Arts Creative team Dimension Plus and a Finnish designer-artist Tuomo Tammenpää. The idea of the workshop is to bring together curious minds from Taiwan and Finland and gather cultural idiosyncrasies of both cultures, put them in the proverbial slow boil and see what comes out of it, whether it is about actual food, traditions, music or local curiosities. 

The first Culture Stew workshop took place in Taipei in September 2019 over three days. The next iteration of it was planned to be had in Finland in 2020 in collaboration with Pixelache & Norpas festivals. COVID-19 altered the plans to convert the 2020 gathering in Finland to two local gatherings, one in Taipei, Taiwan, one in Kemiö, Finland and connect the smaller gatherings with online conferencing tools. This workshop took place on August 5th and 6th, 2020.


### Context ###

Finland and Taiwan – countries and cultures 8000 km apart. One with climate in the border of the arctic, the other close the tropics. Finland, big land – few people. Taiwan, small island – lot of people. Finland bordering Big Russia – Taiwan, Big China. Potatoes, bread and coffee versus rice, tofu and tea. Heavy metal meets mandopop. Finns “chill” in the sauna, Taiwanese in the hot springs. Many differences – some similarities.

### Call for participation (Finland) ###

Join us for Culture Stew 2020, Hack Culture Finland x Taiwan in Kemiö on August 5th 2020, 10am–4pm. This year we stew ideas from traditions of healing with the herbal connoisseurs from Taiwan and Finland. We make tea eggs, learn about moxibustion. We compare embodied memories of back scratching and Sauna culture and scale bitterness from Taiwanese and Finnish ingredients in the quest for sharing an sensory experience online.
Workshop format is two parallel workshops, one in Taiwan, one in Finland, connected together with online conferencing tools. The workshop is also an experiment for improving the methods for remote collaboration.
Max 10 participants.

## Workshop report ##


Culture Stew, Hack Culture Taiwan x Finland, is a workshop series by New Media Arts Creative team Dimension Plus and a Finnish designer-artist Tuomo Tammenpää. The idea of the workshop is to bring together curious minds from Taiwan and Finland and gather cultural idiosyncrasies of both cultures, put them in the proverbial slow boil and see what comes out of it, whether it is about actual food, traditions, music, or local curiosities. 

The first Culture Stew workshop took place in Taipei in September 2019 over three days. The next iteration of it was planned to be had in Finland in 2020 in collaboration with Pixelache & Norpas festivals. COVID-19 altered the plans to convert the 2020 gathering in Finland to two local gatherings, one in Taipei, Taiwan, one in Kemiö, Finland, and connect the smaller gatherings with online conferencing tools. 

This connected “tandem-workshop” took take place on August 5th and 6th, 2020, and gathered about 30 participants in Taipei and a dozen in Kemiö. The workshop started with a presentation of Taiwan and its culture, aimed at the audience in Finland. In the nature of the "stew" in the Culture Stew workshops, we started the slow boil of Taiwanese tea eggs from the herbs received from Taiwan. 

The "Healing Shapes" workshop segment explored the culture of home remedies between Finnish and Taiwanese participants, especially the knowledge that can be preserved in sensational objects, such as Moxa, or body movement - such as back scratch & "vihtominen" in the sauna. In the hands-on part of the segment, we brewed Mogwort tea and kneaded the dough for Mogwort-bean dumplings, and cooked them for a lunch snack. 

The "Bitter is Better" workshop segment was about the exploration of the sensation of bitterness, its defensive properties, and how differently we perceive the bitter taste. For sharing our experiences over the video call, we had received a collection of herbs from Taiwan and brewed together with the same selection of herbal infusions, tasted and scaled them, and shared our expressions of faces sipping the various degrees of happiness for much of mixed enjoyment and repulsion. The mandarin saying of "Sweetness comes after bitterness" worked as a metaphor of hope in the midst of a global pandemic that separated us.

The workshop concluded with the communal consumption of the slow-boiled tea eggs to be followed with more improvised cookings, a sauna session, and a follow-up video call the next morning with a presentation of Finnish culture to the Taiwanese audience.

14:00 Session 3 “Bitter is Better”

Bitterness is probably the most unlikable and unbearable taste for human tongues, and naturally it contrasts strongly to the taste of sweetness. The reason that bitterness becomes the most susceptive sense of taste might results from the fact that most bitter-tasting substances are toxic, such as alkaloids. Consequently, the human body produces many bitter-tasting substance receptors to avoid harm. Aversion to bitterness is the our bodies' defense mechanism. Therefore, to increase our tolerance for bitterness acquires learning and training. Furthermore, our fondness for bitterness might also represents our cultural background.

Besides taste, bitterness is often associated with unbearable sensation such as pain, discomfort, suffering and toil in the body and even the mind. Due to COVID-19, people from all around the world is now suffering from all forms of pain. The original workshops have also been adjusted to held online through only audio and video, losing the possibilities to sync our sharing experience of smell, taste, etc. By designing the bitterness scale collaboratively, participants from all over the world bring various types of bitterness, depicting what bitterness is to them, classifying various types of bitterness according to their own feelings, and in the end we use mugwort water as the reference value to draw our own rating scale for bitterness.

Bitterness will also be made into kué with sweet red beans wrapped inside. The sweetness comes as an aftertaste when eaten together. As an old saying in Mandarin goes, "Sweetness comes after bitterness," we hope that everyone can embrace happiness together in our workshop amidst this global epidemic situation.
