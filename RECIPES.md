# Recipes
This is a collection of experiments from the first workshop in DAC, Taipei, September 16th-18th, 2019. Documentation will be continuosly updated.

## Food

**Tatung cooker volumes:**

Tatung cooker comes with a plastic cup of size 1gō = 180ml (not US/imperial cup size) of which volumes are based on. The inner pot has also line-markings 1,2,-> (~340ml/line) matching how many gō-cups rice needs water eg 3 gō-cups rice = fill inner pot to line 3 with water, _including_ the rice. The cooker itself (outer pot) needs water in proportional to the cooking time: 0.5-1 gō-cups water for 1-4 cups rice, 1.5 for 5-10 cups etc.

**Aromipesä -insulator/thermos**

Aromipesä is a Finnish variant of kettle-insulator/thermos form late 90's TV-shop fame. It cooks food with it's initial heating energy. After bringing food to boil, the kettle is packed in the cell-foam(EPP) plastic container for a slow cook. Using insulator/thermos for slow cooking is a great energy-saver (TBD: calculations)

### Rice

Stories: "How to repel zombies with sticky rice"

**Cooker:**

* Wash rice (eg. 1dl / person)
* Rice + Water ratio  1:1
* Measure 1 Tatung-cup  to outer pot
* Flip the switch, wait for 30mins 

**Thermos:**

* Wash rice (eg. 1dl / person)
* Rice + Water ratio  1:1
* Bring to boil, cook couple of minutes

**Thermos:**

* Soak peas overnight, 250g for four
* Boil in 1,5l water for 10 mins
* Onions: traditions vary, some boil with peas, some chop raw on top
* Carrots: traditions vary, some boil shaved  carrots with peas
* Marjoram: traditions vary, season with 1 tbsp
* Meat: traditions vary, some smoked pork is common in non-veg. soup 
* Pack the kettle in thermos for +4 hours  
* Season with salt
* Mix gently for a clear soup, more vigorously for mushy soup, even with a mixer.
* Garnish: traditions vary, add mustard and raw onion on top

### Carelian stew (or hot-pot) / Karjalanpaisti

Stories: "If we eat meat, we should eat all the parts"

**Thermos:** 

* 800g meat (left-over parts, nothing prime: beef, pork, lamb)
* Fry the meat in pan if some colour is favoured
* Chop two onions in wedges
* Chop two carrots in chunks
* Lay meat and vegs in the kettle in layers
* Add water to cover ingredients
* Add 10x allspice
* Add couple of bay leaf
* Bring to boil and cook for 10 mins
* Pack in thermos for +3 hours
* Season with salt


**Cooker:**

* Preparation same as above
* Cook at least 2x with 2x gō-cups water in outer pot, push the heater on when first cook pops it up
* Leave on "warming" for +2 hours
* Season with salt


**Ideas:** 

* Taipei-night market version: Intestines, head, liver 
* Roadkill version (Fin): Roadkill deer available from hunting associations  
* Lab-printed meat when available <br>
(veg.protein versions likely too far off to be called "paisti")
