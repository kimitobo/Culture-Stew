## Food

**Tatung cooker volumes:**

Tatung cooker comes with a plastic cup of size 1gō = 180ml (not US/imperial cup size) of which volumes are based on. The inner pot has also line-markings 1,2,-> (~340ml/line) matching how many gō-cups rice needs water eg 3 gō-cups rice = fill inner pot to line 3 with water, _including_ the rice. The cooker itself (outer pot) needs water in proportional to the cooking time: 0.5-1 gō-cups water for 1-4 cups rice, 1.5 for 5-10 cups etc.
